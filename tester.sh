#!/bin/bash

# This script will flex whatever .l file(s) and bison whatever
# .y file(s) are in the directory from which it is run. It will
# then g++ the resulting .tab.c file(s) creating an executable
# named a.out
#
# Then it will run a.out on every file in a directory named
# sample_input writing the output to a directory named
# actual_output
#
# Finally, it will do a diff on each file in actual_output
# against the file with the same name that is in a directory
# named expected_output and report the differences in a
# directory named reports
#
# To run this script, do the following:
# (1) Make sure you do NOT have a directory named actual_output
# (2) Make sure you do NOT have a directory named reports
# (3) Make sure you have a directory named sample_input that
#     contains ONLY the sample input files you want to test
# (4) Make sure you have a directory named expected_output
#     that contains ONLY the expected output files, one for each
#     of the files in the sample_input directory
# (5) Make sure you have ONLY a single .l file in this directory
# (6) Make sure you have ONLY a single .y file in this directory
# (7) bash tester.sh
#
# If you get an ioctl error on any file other than summary.txt
# while running the script, rm the actual_output and reports
# directories, and restart from step (7)

# If you make any changes to this script in Windows, you must
# run dos2unix on it before running it with bash
# The following is also equivalent to running dos2unix on this
# file to get rid of the \r's:
# perl -i -p -e "s/\r//" tester.sh
